# ✖️ [hex-service](https://github.com/eserozvataf/hex-service)

Hex Service is a service boilerplate to enable developers to start coding their **forward-compatible** backend projects immediately.

However, the motivation behind the project may sound familiar, and there are tons of boilerplates already that serve this purpose, hex-service allows you to run your code for **both** `Deno` and `Node.js`.

Since hex-service provides an orthogonal solution for `Deno` and `Node.js` code sharing, it's a perfect boilerplate for developers who want to be able to stick with modern tooling by using them immediately. hex-service simply runs on Deno's powerful ecosystem, which providers many developer tools and libraries built-in. Additionally, it allows you to compile your code in order to run on good old `Node.js`.


## Features

* Built on [Deno](https://deno.land) and Oak. So it supports Modern Web APIs.
* Can be compiled to run on `Node.js` as well.
* Transpiles [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React JSX](https://reactjs.org/) out of the box.
* Separated middleware and actions.
* Simple TDD convention and testing environment.
* Ready to debug on VS Code or Chromium Inspector.
* Ready to containerize.
* [WIP] Development mode.
* [WIP] MongoDB connection support.
* [WIP] JWT authentication middleware.
* [TODO] Built-in [Swagger](https://swagger.io) support.


## Quick start

Ensure that `Deno` or `Node.js` is installed on your system first.

Clone this git repo `git clone
   https://github.com/eserozvataf/hex-service.git` - and checkout the [tagged
   release](https://github.com/eserozvataf/hex-service/releases) you'd like to
   use.

**Important**: local env files (i.e., `.env.local`) is git-ignored, so you can
have secret your sensitive environment variables by creating local copies of
environment variables before running the service.
