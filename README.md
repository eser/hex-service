# ✖️ [hex-service](https://github.com/eserozvataf/hex-service)

Hex Service is a service boilerplate to enable developers to start coding their backend API
codebase immediately. By emerging Deno's simplicity typescript and ecmascript modules are
ready to use with zero configuration.


## Features

* Built on [Deno](https://deno.land) and Oak.
* Separated middleware and actions.
* Simple TDD convention
* Ready to containerize
* [TODO] Development mode


## Quick start

Ensure that `Deno` is installed on your system first.

Clone this git repo `git clone
   https://github.com/eserozvataf/hex-service.git` - and checkout the [tagged
   release](https://github.com/eserozvataf/hex-service/releases) you'd like to
   use.

**Important**: `.env` file is git-ignored, so you have to run `cp .env.sample .env`
before running the service.
